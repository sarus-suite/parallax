# parallax

*parallax* turbocharges Rootless Podman on HPC systems by providing an efficient and read-only container image storage for parallel filesystems. With parallax, users can migrate images, leverage SquashFS, and manage distributed storage.
*parallax* is a Go utility that directly uses the container storage libraries to ensure compatibility with Podman.

## Why parallax?
* Pull-once, run-everywhere. Run Podman with a container image store located in parallel filesystems, avoiding redundant image pulls across cluster nodes.
* Faster and lighter containers. It uses SquashFS images that boosts start times and runtimes, reducing IO contention with Read-Only shared storage.
* Maintain compatibility with existing workflows. No changes to Podman itself.

## How it works?
Parallax leverages existing container libraries for image handling, and a lightweight mount program to integrate SquashFS into Podman’s overlay driver—no C code or recompilation of Podman required.

* Migrate your container image to a shared, read-only store (parallax --migrate):
    * Pull & mount source image.
    * Flatten into a dummy layer + generate SquashFS side-car.
    * Record layer link in the read-only store.
* Integrates with Podman overlay storage driver via a custom mount program that provides overlay + SquashFS support.
    * Enables HPC containers via Podman
    * Use with Podman --storage-opt additionalimagestore=… --storage-opt mount\_program=…/parallax-mount-program.sh.
    * Podman’s overlay driver invokes Parallax mount program instead of the overlay driver default.
    * Parallax mount program transparently mounts and overlays the SquashFS layer for your container, then it automatically unmounts when the container exits.
* Easy management. Listing and removing image data from the store.
    * Finds the migrated image in the store.
    * Deletes the SquashFS side-car files.
    * Removes the image record from the store.

## Quick start
### 0. Install dependencies
~~~
go >= 1.24
libbtrfs-dev
device-mapper-devel
fuse-overlayfs
mksquashfs (with zstd support)
squashfuse >= 0.5.1 (with zstd support)
inotifywait
rsync
~~~

### 1. Build
~~~
    go mod tidy
    go build -o parallax
~~~

### 2. Pull an image
~~~
    podman \
        --root "/path/to/your/podmanroot" \
        --runroot "/path/to/runroot" \
        pull docker.io/library/hello-world:linux
~~~

### 3. Migrate an Image
~~~
    parallax \
        --podmanRoot "/path/to/your/podmanroot" \
        --roStoragePath "/path/to/your/nfs/parallax/store" \
        --mksquashfsPath "/path/to/your/mksquashfs/binary" \
        --log-level info \
        --migrate \
        --image docker.io/library/hello-world:linux
~~~

### 4. Run from parallax store
~~~
    podman \
        --root "/path/to/your/podmanroot" \
        --runroot "/path/to/runroot" \
        --storage-opt additionalimagestore=/path/nfs/parallax/store \
        --storage-opt mount_program=/parallax_path/scripts/parallax-mount-program.sh \
        run --rm docker.io/library/hello-world:linux
~~~
Note: using `--storage-opt` cli option makes podman ignore the default storage configuration file.

### 5. List images
~~~
    podman \
        --root "/path/to/your/podmanroot" \
        --storage-opt additionalimagestore=/path/nfs/parallax/store \
        images
~~~

### 6. Remove an image
~~~
    parallax \
        --podmanRoot "/path/to/your/podmanroot" \
        --roStoragePath "/path/to/your/nfs/parallax/store" \
        --mksquashfsPath "/path/to/your/mksquashfs/binary" \
        --log-level info \
        --rmi \
        --image docker.io/library/hello-world:linux
~~~


## Requirements
* Go 1.22+
* Podman 5.5.0+
* System utilities: mksquashfs, fuse-overlayfs, squashfuse, inotifywait
* Linux

## Technical overview

* parallax utility helps you migrate and manage an enhanced, distributed, read-only image store for Podman.
* parallax-mount-program.sh: Is a mount program to be used by Podman that makes usage of the enhanced store transparent.

## Podman Integration: Custom Overlay Mount Program
Parallax is designed to work with Podman’s overlay storage, especially for parallel filesystems like NFS-backeds enhancing them with read-only SquashFS stores.
Use the provided script [`scripts/parallax-mount-program.sh`](scripts/parallax-mount-program.sh) as the Podman overlay `mount_program`. This enables:
- Automatic SquashFS mounting of migrated images
- Robust mount/unmount logic for NFS and similar backends
- Enhanced logging and dependency checks
- To be used as `--storage-opt mount_program=...` in Podman
- Requires: fuse-overlayfs, squashfuse, inotifywait

## Technical Design Goals

* Integrates with existing container libraries avoiding custom code when possible. Relies on well-tested libraries (containers/storage, container/image, opencontainers/go-digest)
* Simple project structure. Modular and with clear separation of concerns to facilitate maintainability and readibility.
* Explicit CLI interface. Uses Go core flag package, for simplicity.
* Robust logging. Structured logging via logrus library, for enhancing debugging and monitoring.
* Strong Error Handling. We try to enforce good use of error handling, explicit logging of issues, and graceful shutdowns.

## Disclaimers

1. **Linux kernel & FUSE required**  
   Parallax only works on Linux with a modern kernel and FUSE support. You must install both `squashfuse` and `fuse-overlayfs`.

2. **Unmount delays**  
   The mount program uses `inotifywait` to detect container exit and unmount SquashFS layers. On very busy, NFS, or parallel-fs setups, unmounts may not be instantaneous.

3. **Read-only store**
   All migrated images live in a read-only SquashFS store; container writes happen in an overlay “upper” layer. **Do not** manually delete `.squash` side-cars directly, use the rmi command to prevent store corruption.

4. **Image size reporting**
   Podman reports only an empty layer size, not the actual compressed SquashFS image.

5. **Logging path**
   By default, logs are written to `/tmp/parallax-<UID>/mount_program.log`. Ensure this directory is writable and periodically cleaned to avoid filling `/tmp`.

6. **Rootless only**
   Parallax has been tested only in a rootless Podman (user-namespace) setup. Running as root is untested and may require extra privileges.

7. **Dynamic Linking Requirement**
    Parallax relies on the containers/storage Go library in rootless mode, which depends on accessing the unshare system capability for user-namespace operations. This functionality is only available when the Parallax binary is dynamically linked (i.e., not statically compiled). Static binaries will produce start-up errors.

8. **FUSE3 and fusermount3 required**
   Parallax is built against FUSE3 and expects `fusermount3`. If you use a `fusermount` version < 3.0, you will see errors like:
~~~
  ERROR: Mounting squash file. failed: fuse: mountpoint is not empty
fuse: if you are sure this is safe, use the 'nonempty' mount option
  ERROR: squashfuse failed
~~~
Please upgrade to FUSE3 (and ensure `fusermount` symlinks to `fusermount3`) to avoid this issue.
